Be Prepared for the Unexpected. Create Your Free ICE Card.

In an emergency, when seconds matter, clear communication can be the difference between life and death. 
The ICE Card Generator is a free, public utility designed to help you create a personalized "In Case of Emergency" card to carry in your wallet. 
It’s built on a single, non-negotiable principle: your safety and your privacy come first.

How It Works:
Choose Your Privacy Level:
Static Card (100% Offline & Private): All your information is encoded directly into the QR code itself. 
Nothing is ever saved or transmitted online. This is the most secure and private option.
Dynamic Card (Online Profile): If you have extensive information, you can create a QR code that links to an online page that you manage and control.
Fill in Your Details: Use our simple, bilingual form to enter your essential data—blood type, allergies, medical conditions, and emergency contacts.
Download Your PDF: Instantly generate a professionally designed, double-sided PDF. It's formatted to be printed on a single A4 page, ready to be cut out and placed in your wallet.

Our Philosophy:
We believe essential safety tools should be accessible to everyone, without compromising privacy. 
The ICE Card Generator is free, requires no sign-up, and will never store your personal data. 
It’s a tool for peace of mind, built for a global community of travelers, athletes, parents, and anyone who wants to be prepared.
